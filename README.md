ITDEV162: Client/Server Ecommerce Implementation

This is a full-stack application I made using SQLite and MS Entity framework for the server. It has a back end that consists of our API, Domain, and 
Applicationn folders. I used postman to test the functionality of the API endpoints and used React for the front end client project. Our blogbox.sln 
was what links the front end to the backend.
